<!--the game is a space invader game that only has one life
     in order to get more lives players must get trivia answers correctly
    in this case it would be targeted for 10-15 year old kids that are in the spectrum and 
    are learning basic math skills like using money(thus the questions will be basic standard questions like
    "how much is an quater worth?")
    1. write a basic page where the player can have a very simple and easy UI experience
    2. i would like to create the space game first, then proceed with intergrading the trivia questions and adding them to the 
     game using JS-->
