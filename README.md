<!--the game is a space invader game that only has one life
     in order to get more lives players must get trivia answers correctly
    in this case it would be targeted for 10-15 year old kids that are in the spectrum and 
    are learning basic math skills like using money(thus the questions will be basic standard questions like
    "how much is an quater worth?")
    1. write a basic page where the player can have a very simple and easy UI experience
    2. i would like to create the space game first, then proceed with intergrading the trivia questions and adding them to the 
     game using JS-->

The entire development project was truly a learning experience.  Although I did not get the product I wanted, I will continue to work on 
it until it has reached the final product.  The game had a couple of bugs that difinetly need to be fixed before the game development on-goes. 
I would like to add levels to the game and incorporate a card flipping trivia as well.
